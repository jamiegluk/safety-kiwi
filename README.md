**This website is not by me, I am simply hosting it, with permission.**  
Project originally created as part of a Computing BSc (Hons) dissertation for [Abertay University](https://abertay.ac.uk), Dundee (UK).

There is no build process, raw code from the [www](www) folder will be automatically deployed live online when a new release is published.

Run `yarn install` and use [Prettier](https://prettier.io) (IDE or cli) to format files in root.  
Files in _www_ folder are excluded from formatting, as-original.  
Preferred IDE is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
